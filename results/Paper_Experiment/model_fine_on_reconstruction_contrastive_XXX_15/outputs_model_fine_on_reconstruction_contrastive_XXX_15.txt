project_description: 
oject applies a unified ViT-based model for modulation classification using 
reconstruction and contrastive learning without a teacher-student framework.
The training is conducted on the RML2018 dataset using selective class indices,
with 15% labeled data and optional data augmentations for self-supervised contrastive learning.
